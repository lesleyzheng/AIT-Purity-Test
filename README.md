# AITPurityTest

# What is this?

We are creating an interactive Android mobile app that scores then analyzes a student's AIT (Acquincum Institute of Technology) Study Abroad Experience. This app was inspired by the Rice Purity Test. The questions are modified to be specific to AIT students who have studied abroad spring 2020.

# What features do we have?

- Login using Firebase Authentication 
- Interactive survey using Quick Bird Studios
- Scores stored in Firebase under unique ids for privacy
- Results page with a bar graph that compares your score against everyone else's score

# Extensions

We hope to add further question-based analysis.
