        "The (Official) AIT Purity Test was inspired by the Rice Purity Test "
        "and serves as a segue from college life at US colleges to true study "
        "abroad life at the Acquincum Institute of Technology, Budapest. It’s "
        "a voluntary opportunity for the AIT student groups to bond, and for"
        "students to track the maturation of their experiences throughout their "
        "study abroad semester.\n\n"
        "Caution: This is not a bucket list. Completion of all items on this test does not make you cooler.\n\n"
